# -ITSTEP-Final-Project
## Project task
The task was to create a search system,
providing an opportunity for visitors to search for publications in the library and view information about them. 

Editions are distributed to books, magazines, newspapers, encyclopedias and
dictionaries. 

Visitors have the opportunity to study in detail
each edition, looking at its full title, author,
publisher, genre, topic, number of pages and year
publications.

The system must use a function to
viewing information about newly received editions for
every month.

Since publications are regularly delivered to the library, it is required to implement a publication manager for the head librarian. Functions such as add and remove editions
to the base are required for implementation.

The important detail in functionality is functions
sorting. Sorting of publications by criteria should be done
| A-Z | and | MIN-MAX |.

Using a dynamic array of structures is also not
should stay aloof.

The program should be designed in an ergonomic
interface, and also have accompanying documentation.
There must be a rendering of functions and procedures in
separate files (header files).

The database must be in the form of a text or binary file. The files will change depending on the addition or removal of objects.
